Just storing notes on basic Git commands and what to do in certain situations.

BASIC COMMANDS:

$ git init                // Initializes the local git repository

$ git add <file name>     // Adds files to index, we can add as many files as we like before committing

$ git status              // Check the status of the working tree, so we can see what changes have been made\

$ git commit              // Commit changes takes all the changes from the staging area and puts it into the local repository
